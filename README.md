Handy place to keep things such as `.bash_profile` and `.vimrc`.

I've got a few machines I've been setting up recently (or will be setting up in
the near future), and the number of config files I want to sync keeps
increasing--so my previous strategy of individual symlinks in Dropbox was
getting a little out of hand, especially since I hadn't had a dedicated place
to store them in there.

Hence this repo.

There's a quick installer script for simplicity's sake, and I'm planning to
keep personal info overrideable in case anyone else is interested.

Anyway, just clone this somewhere out of the way and run `install.sh` to kick
things off.
